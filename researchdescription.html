  <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="6z68kgk5wp84">Programmed cell death is a naturally-occurring cellular process in which cells self-destruct by activation of an intrinsic suicide program. Like cell proliferation, cell death is an essential aspect of animal development and homeostasis. Both processes are tightly controlled so that cell numbers in tissues and organs are maintained at appropriate levels. Misregulation of programmed cell death may underlie many human diseases including cancers, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and immunodeficiency diseases.</p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="nx250xfhvgpl">We use the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> as a model system to study how programmed cell death is regulated, activated and executed, because <em>C. elegans</em> is uniquely amenable to both molecular genetic and biochemical analyses and because the cell death pathway is conserved between nematodes and mammals. The study of cell death in nematodes can provide crucial information towards understanding cell death mechanisms in humans, and ultimately, may identify means to combat human diseases caused by inappropriate apoptosis.</p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="8a49whta3ssp">Genetic studies in <em>C. elegans</em>  have identified many genes that are important for five sequential steps of programmed cell death (see Figure below): the decision-making step of which cells should die, the activation of the cell death program, the execution of the cell-killing process, the engulfment of cell corpses, and finally, the degradation of cellular debris. Several genes have been cloned and found to encode proteins homologous to factors involved in mammalian cell death, including two transcription factors (ces-1 and ces-2), a BH3-domain-containing cell-death initiator (egl-1), a cysteine protease that executes the suicide program (ced-3), a putative activator of the CED-3 death protease (ced-4, a homolog of mammalian death protease activator Apaf-1), and a cell-death inhibitor similar to the mammalian cell-survival factor Bcl-2 (ced-9). The CED-3 death protease is particularly interesting. CED-3 is first synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and later is activated through proteolysis, which then triggers the activation of the cell-death program and a series of cellular and morphological changes in the dying cells. Thus the study of how CED-3 is activated and how it acts to cause cell death offers a great paradigm for studying the regulation and execution of programmed cell death.</p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="up5sbdpf18wz">Using a combination of genetic, molecular biological, biochemical and structural biological approaches, we are examining the regulation and the expression of theced-3 gene in <em>C.elegans</em>, the interactions of the CED-3 protein with other proteins in the cell death pathway, and the mechanism of CED-3 activation. We have performed both genetic and biochemical screens to identify proteins that regulate the activation or activity of the CED-3 death protease and proteins that are substrates of the CED-3 death protease. So far, we have identified at least fourteen new genes (cps-1 to cps-14; <a href="Proteases.html">CED-3 protease suppressors</a>) that act downstream of, or in parallel to, the CED-3 death protease to cause cell death and at least eight new genes that function to activate the CED-3 death protease in specific subsets of cells (<a href="regulation.html">please see detailed description</a>). We have also initiated biochemical and structural analysis of crucial protein interactions and mechanisms that are involved in the activation of the CED-3 protease (<a href="activation.html">please see detailed description</a>). Molecular genetic characterization and biochemical and structural analysis of these new cell-death genes and their interactions with other cell death factors in <em>C.elegans</em> will help elucidate how programmed cell death is regulated, activated and executed in general.</p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="3h5mx2g9qi0g">We recently cloned the cps-6 gene and found that cps-6 encodes a homologue of human mitochondrial endonuclease G (endoG) (<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v412/n6842/abs/412090a0_fs.html" data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="af45241uxbxe">Abstract</a> ). In collaboration with Dr. Xiaodong Wang group at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, we showed that the CPS-6 protein localizes to <em>C.elegans </em>mitochondria and possesses an endonuclease activity that is capable of inducing the generation of apoptotic DNA ladders in isolated Hela cell nuclei. Furthermore, we found that the mouse EndoG can substitute the functions of cps-6 in <em>C.elegans</em>, suggesting that CPS-6 and EndoG define an evolutionarily conserved DNA degradation pathway. Our study demonstrated for the first time that the mitochondria is important for apoptosis in invertebrates and is a conserved regulator of apoptosis.</p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="xaipksmzi9t6">The finding that cps-6 encodes a mitochondrial endonuclease prompted us to examine whether there are additional mitochondrial proteins involved in <em>C.elegans</em> apoptosis. We characterized the <em>C.elegans</em> homologue of AIF, a human mitochondrial oxidoreductase that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis to induce chromosome condensation and fragmentation. Intriguingly, the oxidoreductase activity of AIF is dispensable for its apoptogenic functions and AIF does not possess a nuclease activity, raising a major question of how AIF induces apoptosis. We cloned the worm AIF homologue, wah-1, and used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to study its functions in <em>C.elegans</em> apoptosis (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/298/5598/1587" data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="50ahc9ck7wvm">Abstract</a> and <a href="PDF Files/WAH-1.pdf">PDF</a>). We found that reduction of the wah-1 activity in <em>C.elegans</em> delays the normal progression of apoptosis, results in accumulation of TUNEL-positive DNA breaks, and enhances the defects of other cell death mutants, indicating that <em>C.elegans</em> AIF does play an important role in regulating <em>C.elegans</em> apoptosis. Interestingly, wah-1(RNAi) results in cell death phenotypes that are similar to those of the cps-6 mutant and fails to further enhance the cps-6 cell death defects, indicating that wah-1 and cps-6 function in the same cell death pathway. Indeed, we found that WAH-1 which also localizes to <em>C.elegans</em> mitochondria can associate and cooperate with CPS-6 in vitro to promote DNA degradation. In vivo, co-expression of wah-1 and cps-6 can synergistically induce cell killing. These findings indicate that CPS-6/EndoG is likely a target or effector that WAH-1/AIF interacts with to induce chromosome fragmentation during apoptosis and that CSP-6/EndoG and WAH-1/AIF define a single evolutionarily conserved cell death pathway initiated from mitochondria. Importantly, we fund that WAH-1 can be released from mitochondria by EGL-1, a <em>C.elegans</em> BH-3-domain containing cell death activator, in a manner similar to the release of cytochrome c or EndoG from mitochondria by mammalian BH3-domain containing proteins such as Bid or Bim. Interestingly, this EGL-1-induced release of WAH-1 is dependent on the activity of the CED-3 protease, indicating that worm AIF functions in a caspase-dependent manner. These observations strongly suggest that the mitochondrial cell death pathway is conserved between nematodes and humans.</a></p>

    <p data-gwd-node="true" data-gwd-uuid="kf2wlohrudke">We are now in the process of identifying additional mitochondrial factors that are important for the regulation and execution of programmed cell death in <em>C.elegans</em> using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We are particularly interested in understanding how mitochondrial apoptogenic factors are released from mitochondria to affect various aspects of apoptosis. We hope to identify most components functioning in <em>C.elegans</em> mitochondrial cell death pathways.
