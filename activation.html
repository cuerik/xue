  <p>In the nematode <em>C. elegans</em>, three genes <em>egl-1</em>, <em>ced-3</em>, and <em>ced-4</em>, are required for activation of programmed cell death whereas one gene, <em>ced-9</em>, prevents programmed cell death. Molecular characterization of these genes has shown that <em>egl-1</em> encodes a BH3-only (<u>B</u>cl-2 <u>h</u>omology domain <u>3</u>) cell death activator, <em>ced-3</em> encodes an aspartate-specific cysteine protease (caspase), <em>ced-4</em> encodes an Apaf-1-like (<u>a</u>poptotic <u>p</u>rotease<u>a</u>ctivating <u>f</u>actor-<u>1</u>) protein, and <em>ced-9</em> encodes a Bcl-2 homologue. Genetic studies have placed these genes in a negative regulatory pathway, with <em>egl-1 </em>antagonizing the activity of <em>ced-9</em>, which inhibits the activity o f<em>ced-4</em> to activate CED-3 and eventually cell death. In combination with <em>in vitro</em> biochemical studies, these genetic findings suggest that a protein interaction cascade involving EGL-1, CED-9, CED-4, and CED-3 regulates the activation of programmed cell death in <em>C. elegans</em>. We have initiated biochemical, structural, and genetic analyses to study the mechanisms that activate the death protease CED-3, including the protein interactions involved in this activation process. Specifically, we are attempting to reconstitute the events necessary for activation of CED-3 <em>in vitro</em> using purified recombinant proteins. Furthermore, we are using a structural modeling approach to analyze these protein interactions and guide our efforts to demonstrate the importance of these protein interactions <em>in vivo</em>. So far, we have been able to recapitulate the early events of cell death activation <em>in vitro</em>, including the EGL-1 mediated release of CED-4 from CED-4/CED-9 complexes and are in the process of purifying additional factors that are required for the activation of CED-3. Structural modeling of the EGL-1/CED-9 complex and corresponding biochemical analyses have revealed important molecular interactions between EGL-1 and CED-9 and the nature of an unusual gain-of-function mutation in <em>ced-9</em>, facilitating successful design of its second-site suppressor mutations. Further studies of this kind should help address the central question of how cell death and the cell death protease CED-3 are activated in the appropriate cells and at the right time.</p>

  <p>Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays an essential role in maintaining the physiological balance of appropriate cell numbers by opposing uncontrolled cell proliferation. The pathway of programmed cell death appears to be highly conserved from <em>C. elegans</em> to mammals, suggesting that studies of programmed cell death in <em>C. elegans</em> can provide important information for understanding how cell death is regulated and executed in mammals. Moreover, novel ways developed in <em>C. elegans</em> to modulate programmed cell death may also be applied to mammals for better detection, prevention as well as treatment of human diseases caused by abnormal apoptosis (e.g. cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases). In this study, we are employing the technique of SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential amplification) to identify small RNA aptamers with high binding specificity and affinity for key cell death regulators, including CED-9 and CED-4 from C.elegans as well as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL from humans. We hope to use these RNA aptamers to probe how Bcl-2 family proteins regulate programmed cell death in both <em>C. elegans</em> and mammalian cells. More importantly, if these RNA aptamers can be used to successfully modulate the process of programmed cell death in <em>C. elegans</em>, they may provide important insights into devising new diagnostic and therapeutic drugs to treat cancer and various apoptosis-related diseases. So far, we have conducted several rounds of SELEX experiments on CED-9, CED-4 and Bcl-xL and have obtained candidate molecules with increasing binding affinity in vitro to these proteins. After more rounds of selections, we will investigate in detail the potential effects of candidate RNA aptamers on in vitro activities of these key cell death regulators as well as their potential effects on apoptosis in <em>C. elegans</em> and in mammalian cells.</p>
